###*Measurements
There is a total of 17 measurements, wherein 8 of which have three sublevels denoted as the 3-axial signals in the X, Y, and Z directions. Totaling to 33 measurements listed as follow:

tBodyAcc-Y
tBodyAcc-Z
tGravityAcc-X
tGravityAcc-Y
tGravityAcc-Z
tBodyAccJerk-X

Since the focus of this project is the means and standard deviations (std) of the measurements, the overall number of measurements which are thereafter averaged is 66.

After tidying the data, the variable names resulted as:
